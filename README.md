Poser is a web version of a Fake Artist Goes to New York, by Oink Games.
It's still a work in progress, more to come!

Right now it's just a simple Go app on the backend, with TypeScript and React on the frontend.

## Features and such
Current roadmap:

* [x] Basic backend (creating/joining/leaving rooms, chat, sharing drawing data)
* [x] Simple shared canvas
* [ ] Basic game implementation: assign user colors and implement turns
* [ ] Advance game implementation: voting on the end result, guess for the fake artist
* [ ] Make the UI look nicer
* [ ] UX: custom user names and color picker
* [ ] Gallery: choose to save your final work, content mod tools
